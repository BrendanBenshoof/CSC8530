# Using Load Balancing to Scalably Parallelize Sampling-Based Motion Planning Algorithms

## IPDPS 2014

 Presented by Brendan Benshoof

---

# What is Motion based planning?
- Find a reasonable path for an object through space

- This was initially formulated for robotics, but it has found applications in other areas.

---


## Configuration space

- Given an environment, configuration space describes what regions a robot can and cannot occupy.

## What are C_free and C_obstacle?

- C_free is the set of locations that the 'robot' can feasible exist in without intersecting with an obstacle

- C_obstacle is complement to C_free and represents spaces the 'robot' cannot traverse

- Parts of C_free may be unreachable from a given starting position

# Sample Based Searching

- Test points in Configuration space for validity

- Connect these dots to find a valid path to the target

## Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT)

```
Inputs: environment E, root R, number of nodes P, number of iterations K,
maxium inter-node distance delta


Set Q = [R] //nodes in the tree

Repeat K times:
  Set RandP = P randomly selected points in E

  For p in RandP:
    if p is a valid configuration:
      find: near_Point = closest point in Q to p
      if distance p->near_Point < delta:
        Add p to Q:
          add edge p->near_point

  Output: Q, Tree rooted at R

```

---

## Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM)

```
Inputs: environment E, number of nodes P, number edges K

Set Roadmap Graph R = Empty Set

Samples = P randomly selected points
Add all points in Samples to Roadmap

for x in Samples:
  Peers = K nearest other points in Samples
  for y in Peers:
    Add edge from x->y in R

Output: R, Roadmap of E

```

## How can we balance the load?
- Because we don't know where C_obstacle is before beginning to search, initial allocations of work are imbalanced
- Two major options
    - periodic re-balancing
    - work stealing

---

## Work Balancing

- build a hypersphere in C_space
- break it into regular arcs
    - regular sampling of the surface, then use center->point ray as a voronoi generator
    - they call this a "conic section" however this is a misnomer
- build a region graph
    - delunay peers
- sample and build a tree locally
- link trees across edges

---

### Uniform Radial Subdivision
```
Input: Environment E, root Q, number of nodes N, number of processors P
Output: Road map Graph of E

Set Region Graph R = Null Set

Let R_d = subdivision of E into P regions
add each region of R_d as a vertex to R

for all neighboring regions (r1,r2) in R_d:
  add edge (r1,r2) to R

For all regions r in R_d in parallel:
  G_r = graph constructed using RRT or RPM

For all edges (r1,r2) in R:
  Link subgraphs of r1 and r2


```

# Repartitioning

- The Repartitioning algorithim centers on estimating the workload of a partition and building a weighted partitioning as a result.

- using PMR is easier to predict the workload than RRT

```
Input: Regional graph, sequential planner
Output: Set of constructed RRT branches or PRM
roadmaps
W ← Null Set

for all regions v_i ∈ V par do
  W_i ← ComputeRegionWeight(v_i)

GraphRepartition(R, W)

for all regions v_i ∈ V par do
  G ← Independently construct regional roadmap or RRT using

```

# Work Stealing

- Each processor is assigned a "todo" list of smaller regions
- When a processor has exhausted its own list, it begins to steal work from other regions

- strategies include:
  - Rand-K
    - Choose K random other processors to try and steal work from
  - Diffusive
    - Request work from predetermined peers (2d mesh in examples)
  - Hybrid
    - Initially try Diffusive
    - Fall back on Rand-K if diffusive fails

# Conclusions

- Load balancing strategies can improve the runtime of a parallel algorithm
- In general, load balancing strategies can only mitigate against "worst case" distributions of work. They will not speed up an algorithm's asymptotic behavior.
