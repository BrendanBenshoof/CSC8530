Miller, Russ, and Quentin F. Stout. "Efficient parallel convex hull algorithms." Computers, IEEE Transactions on 37.12 (1988): 1605-1618.
- Miller et al shows algorithms for preforming the convex hull operation given pre-sorted input on a variety of parallel architectures: a hypercube, pyramid,
tree, mesh-of-trees, mesh with reconfigurable bus, EREW PRAM, and a modified AKS network. These algorithms can be shown to be optimal with a running time of O(diameter) or O(log(n)) of the system iff the EREW model is enforced.
- Generalization of Atallah et al onto assorted parallel computing architectures.

- Dehne et al supplies a high-probability of accuracy algorithm on EREW PRAM of O(log(n)) time. Selecting the candidate points is the simpler half of the operation, finding the edges of the hull is approach probabilistically.

- Ghouse et al proposes the O(1) and O(nlog(n)) work algorithm for CRCW PRAM. The convex hull problem is presented as a linear programming problem and solved using probabilistic parallel linear programming techniques. accuracy is low enough that a second error checking sweep is used.
